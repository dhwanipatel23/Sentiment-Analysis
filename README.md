# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis with a pretrained model from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). In particular, it uses the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer (SIA) module within NLTK, which comes with a pretrained model for sentiment analysis.

The model is trained on a vast amount of textual data and has learned to assign sentiment scores to words and phrases. The 'compound score' returned by the SIA represents the overall sentiment of the input text. This pretrained model is part of the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool included in NLTK.

While this example demonstrates a simple way to perform sentiment analysis using pretrained data, keep in mind that for more complex tasks or specific domains, one might need to consider training custom models on domain-specific datasets.
